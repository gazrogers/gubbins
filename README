# So what the hell is this?

It's my latest attempt at creating a repo that show that I can actually do this programming malarky. A silly social
application to demonstrate a simple backend application, a simple frontend app, maybe a mobile app, a useful little
development environment using Docker Compose, and maybe some build and test stuff.

I'm also going to use it to try and implement my own OAuth/OpenConnectID code. Libraries are nice, but sometimes it's
nice to know what's happening under the covers.

I'm starting with what I use in my day job - PHP with Phalcon for the backend. After that, assuming I don't lose
interest, we'll see.
